## How to Reference Images

This repository is configured to ensure images work correctly both on GitHub and GitHub Pages. Use the following formats:

### For direct GitHub viewing:
```
![Image Name](https://github.com/three-horizon/SAP-GitHub-Integration-Playbook/raw/main/assets/images/your-image-name.svg)
```

### For GitHub Pages (with Jekyll):
When creating content for the GitHub Pages site, use this format in your Markdown files:
```
![Image Name]({% raw %}{{ site.baseurl }}{% endraw %}/assets/images/your-image-name.svg)
```

### Using the include helper (recommended for Jekyll):
When creating content for the GitHub Pages site, use this helper:
```
{% raw %}{% include image.html url="/assets/images/your-image-name.svg" alt="Image Description" caption="Optional Caption" %}{% endraw %}
```

### SVG images are preferred for better quality and scalability.
