## Diagram Creation Guidelines

To ensure consistency across all diagrams:

1. **Color Scheme**
   - SAP Blue: #0070f2

2. **Style Guidelines**
   - Use simple, clean vector graphics
   - Include clear labels for all components
   - Use consistent iconography throughout
   - Ensure diagrams are legible at different screen sizes
   - Include directional arrows to show flow

3. **File Format**
   - Primary: SVG (preferred for web usage)
