# 🔗 SAP-GitHub Integration Architecture

## 📋 Overview

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture for integrating SAP systems with GitHub Enterprise, focusing on secure, reliable, and efficient connectivity patterns.

## 🧩 Architecture Components

The SAP-GitHub integration architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **SAP Development Systems** - ABAP development environments where code is written and maintained
2. **GitHub Enterprise** - Source code management and version control platform
3. **Integration Layer** - Middleware components that facilitate communication between systems
4. **Security Components** - Authentication and authorization mechanisms
5. **Monitoring Systems** - Tools to track integration health and performance

## 🔄 Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Integration via abapGit

This pattern uses abapGit to directly connect SAP ABAP systems to GitHub repositories.

### Pattern 2: API-Mediated Integration

This pattern uses API Management to broker communications between SAP systems and GitHub.

### Pattern 3: Event-Driven Integration

This pattern uses event hooks and messaging to create loosely coupled integrations.

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

The security architecture for SAP-GitHub integration includes:

- OAuth 2.0 authentication flows
- Fine-grained access controls
- Secret management
- Audit logging
- Transport layer security
