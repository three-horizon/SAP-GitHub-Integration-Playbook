Automatically created by the SAP-GitHub integration with:
- Title: "Add marketing consent fields to customer master"
- Description: Details of changes and transport request
- Reviewer assignments based on CODEOWNERS file

#### 3.2 Automated Checks

GitHub Actions workflow triggers:
```yaml
name: ABAP Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ dev, qas, main ]
    paths:
      - '**/*.abap'
      - '**/*.xml'

jobs:
  abap_lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: ABAP Lint Check
        uses: my-org/abap-lint-action@v1
        with:
          config_file: .abaplint.json
          
  transport_check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Transport Request Validation
        uses: my-org/sap-transport-check@v1
        with:
          api_endpoint: ${{ secrets.APIM_ENDPOINT }}
          api_key: ${{ secrets.APIM_KEY }}
```

#### 3.3 Manual Code Review

Pull request review with inline comments:
```
Line 45: Consider using a domain for the marketing consent field for better reusability.
Line 67: This authorization check should include the new fields.
```

#### 3.4 Address Review Comments

```
1. Implement feedback in SAP
2. Push additional changes to the same branch
3. Reviewers approve the changes
```

### 4. Development Integration

#### 4.1 Merge to Development Branch

```
1. PR merged to dev branch in GitHub
2. GitHub Actions workflow triggered:
```

```yaml
name: DEV Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches: [ dev ]

jobs:
  deploy_to_dev:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to DEV
        uses: my-org/sap-deploy-action@v1
        with:
          api_endpoint: ${{ secrets.APIM_ENDPOINT }}
          api_key: ${{ secrets.APIM_KEY }}
          target_system: DEV
          transport_request: auto
```

#### 4.2 Transport Creation and Release

The workflow:
1. Calls the API Management endpoint for transport creation
2. Assigns objects to the transport
3. Initiates release to the DEV system
4. Updates GitHub with transport status

2. Test results documented in GitHub issue
3. Defects or adjustments tracked in GitHub
```

### 5. Quality Assurance Deployment

#### 5.1 QAS Branch Integration

```
1. Create PR from dev to qas branch
2. Conduct review of changes for QAS promotion
3. Approve and merge PR
```

#### 5.2 Automated QAS Deployment

GitHub Actions workflow triggers:
```yaml
name: QAS Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches: [ qas ]

jobs:
  deploy_to_qas:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: quality
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to QAS
        uses: my-org/sap-deploy-action@v1
        with:
          api_endpoint: ${{ secrets.APIM_ENDPOINT }}
          api_key: ${{ secrets.APIM_KEY }}
          target_system: QAS
          transport_request: from_dev
```

#### 5.3 QAS Testing and Validation

```
1. UAT conducted in QAS system
2. Test scenarios executed and verified
3. Sign-off tracked in GitHub issue
```

### 6. Production Deployment

#### 6.1 Production Approval

```
1. Create PR from qas to main branch
2. Final production change approval
3. Schedule deployment in change management system
```

#### 6.2 Production Deployment

GitHub Actions workflow triggers:
```yaml
name: PRD Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy_to_prd:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to PRD
        uses: my-org/sap-deploy-action@v1
        with:
          api_endpoint: ${{ secrets.APIM_ENDPOINT }}
          api_key: ${{ secrets.APIM_KEY }}
          target_system: PRD
          transport_request: from_qas
          approval_required: true
```

#### 6.3 Post-Deployment Verification

```
1. Verify changes in production system
2. Execute smoke tests
3. Monitor for issues
4. Close related GitHub issues
```

### 7. Security Monitoring

Throughout the process, Microsoft Sentinel continuously monitors:

```kql
// Sample KQL query monitoring the entire process
SAP_Transport_CL
| where TransportID_s in ("DEVK123457", "QASK234567", "PRDK345678") 
| join kind=inner (
    API_Management_CL 
    | where OperationName has "transport"
) on $left.TransportID_s == $right.TransportId_s
| join kind=inner (
    GitHub_Audit_CL
    | where Repository == "my-org/customer-master-extension"
) on $left.CorrelationId_g == $right.CorrelationId_g
| summarize Activities=count() by TransportID_s, TimeGenerated, OperationName, Status_s
| order by TimeGenerated asc
```

## Benefits Demonstrated

This scenario demonstrated these key benefits:

1. **Automation**: Zero manual synchronization steps between SAP and GitHub
2. **Traceability**: Complete history of changes from requirement to production
3. **Collaboration**: Effective code reviews and teamwork
4. **Security**: Continuous monitoring and validation
5. **Quality**: Multiple validation points before production deployment

## Conclusion

This end-to-end scenario demonstrates how the complete SAP-GitHub integration works across the entire development lifecycle. The integration enables a modern, DevOps-oriented approach to SAP development while maintaining the robust governance and transport management capabilities of SAP systems.

By following similar patterns, teams can implement efficient, automated workflows for all types of SAP development work, from small enhancements to major implementations.
