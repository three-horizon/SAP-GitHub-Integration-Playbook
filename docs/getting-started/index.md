# Getting Started with SAP-GitHub Integration

This section provides the essential information needed to begin your SAP-GitHub integration journey.

## Introduction

SAP-GitHub integration brings modern DevOps practices to SAP development, enabling:

- Version control for SAP code and configurations
- Collaborative development with pull requests and code reviews
- Automated testing and continuous integration
- Streamlined deployments and release management
- Enhanced code quality and governance

## üîß Implementation Approach

We recommend a phased approach to SAP-GitHub integration:

1. **Discovery Phase** - Understand current workflows and define requirements
2. **Pilot Phase** - Implement with a small team and focused scope
3. **Expansion Phase** - Roll out to additional teams and use cases
4. **Optimization Phase** - Refine processes and enhance automation

## Available Documents

The following documents will help you get started:

- [Implementation Checklist](./implementation-checklist.md) - A comprehensive checklist of implementation tasks
- [Prerequisites Guide](./prerequisites.md) - Systems, permissions, and resources needed
- [Business Case Template](./business-case.md) - Template for building your business case
- [Pilot Project Selection](./pilot-selection.md) - Criteria for selecting your first integration project

## Quick Start

For organizations looking to quickly test the integration:

1. Review the [Implementation Checklist](./implementation-checklist.md)
2. Set up a GitHub repository for your SAP code
3. Install abapGit on your SAP development system
4. Configure basic connectivity between systems
5. Test basic version control operations

For a full implementation, follow the complete [Implementation Guide](../).

## Common Questions

### How long does implementation typically take?

The timeline varies based on organization size and complexity:
- Small implementations: 4-6 weeks
- Medium implementations: 2-3 months
- Large enterprise implementations: 3-6 months

### What SAP systems are compatible?

The integration works with:
- SAP S/4HANA (on-premises)
- SAP ECC 6.0 (with appropriate support packages)
- SAP BTP ABAP Environment
- SAP CAP (Cloud Application Programming) Model

### What skills are needed for implementation?

A successful implementation team typically includes:
- SAP ABAP developer(s)
- GitHub administrator
- DevOps engineer
- Security specialist
- Project manager
