# Architecture Diagrams

This directory contains the architecture diagrams used throughout the SAP-GitHub Integration Playbook. These diagrams illustrate key architectural concepts, integration patterns, and implementation approaches.

## Included Diagrams

### Reference Architecture
- `sap-github-reference-architecture.png` - The comprehensive reference architecture
- `high-level-architecture.png` - Simplified view of the integration architecture
- `component-interaction-diagram.png` - Detailed component interaction diagram

### Integration Patterns
- `direct-integration-pattern.png` - Direct integration via abapGit
- `api-mediated-integration-pattern.png` - API-mediated integration pattern
- `event-driven-integration-pattern.png` - Event-driven integration pattern
- `charm-integration.png` - Integration pattern with ChaRM
- `non-charm-integration.png` - Integration pattern without ChaRM

### Process Flows
- `code-synchronization-flow.png` - Code synchronization process flow
- `transport-integration-flow.png` - Transport management integration flow
- `workflow-comparison.png` - Traditional vs. GitHub-enhanced workflow comparison
- `security-integration-diagram.png` - Security integration across components

## Design Guidelines

All architecture diagrams follow these design standards:

1. **Consistent Visual Language**
   - Blue components for SAP systems
   - Green components for GitHub
   - Purple components for integration services
   - Yellow components for security services

2. **Flow Direction**
   - Left-to-right for process flows
   - Top-to-bottom for hierarchical relationships
   - Clear directional arrows for all interactions

3. **Component Size**
   - Proportional to significance in the architecture
   - Consistent within diagram sets
   - Sized for readability at standard display resolutions

4. **Labels and Annotations**
   - Concise, clear labels
   - Additional context provided where needed
   - Consistent font and text styling

## Updating Architecture Diagrams

When updating or adding new diagrams:

1. Follow the established color scheme and visual language
2. Use vector formats where possible (SVG preferred)
3. Maintain consistent naming conventions
4. Update this README.md when adding new diagrams
5. Optimize image files for web display

## Tools

Recommended tools for creating and editing architecture diagrams:

- [draw.io](https://draw.io) / [diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net) (Free, open-source)
- [Lucidchart](https://lucidchart.com) (Commercial)
- [Microsoft Visio](https://products.office.com/visio) (Commercial)
- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) (Free, text-based)

## Source Files

Source files for diagrams (draw.io, Visio, etc.) should be stored in the `source` subdirectory to enable future editing.

**Note**: Placeholder diagram files will be replaced with actual diagrams during implementation.
