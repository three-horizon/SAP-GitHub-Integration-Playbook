## Technical Questions

### How does code synchronization work between SAP and GitHub?

The integration uses abapGit to convert ABAP objects to XML format for storage in Git. Code synchronization follows this process:
1. ABAP objects are serialized to XML using abapGit
2. API Management securely transfers the XML to/from GitHub
3. GitHub stores the XML representations with full version history
4. Changes in GitHub are pulled back to SAP through the same process

### How are transports managed in this integration?

Transports are managed through an automated process:
1. GitHub Actions can create transport requests via API
2. Objects are assigned to transports automatically
3. Transport release is triggered by branch/PR operations
4. Transport status is tracked and reported in GitHub

### Is this a replacement for SAP's transport system?

No, this integration works alongside the standard SAP transport system, not replacing it. It enhances the transport process with automation, traceability, and integration with modern development workflows.

### How does the integration handle concurrent development?

The integration supports concurrent development through Git's branching model:
1. Developers work on separate feature branches
2. Changes are isolated until merged via pull requests
3. Conflicts are detected early and resolved through standard Git mechanisms
4. Transport dependencies are managed to ensure correct sequencing

### What happens if there's a conflict between SAP and GitHub?

Conflicts are handled through standard Git conflict resolution:
1. Conflicts are detected during merge or pull operations
2. Developers can resolve conflicts in the Git repository
3. Once resolved, changes can be synchronized back to SAP
4. For complex conflicts, resolution can happen in SAP followed by a push to Git

### Do developers need GitHub knowledge to use this integration?

Basic Git and GitHub knowledge is beneficial but not required for all team members. The integration provides:
1. Simplified interfaces in SAP for common Git operations
2. Documentation and training materials for developers
3. Gradual adoption path for teams new to Git
