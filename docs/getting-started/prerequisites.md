> **Note**: This is not an exhaustive list. Conduct a system-specific analysis to identify additional required SAP Notes.

### Required SAP Authorizations

#### Technical User Requirements

Create a dedicated technical user in each SAP system (DEV, QAS, PRD) with the following authorizations:

| Authorization Object | Field | Value | Purpose |

| S_DEVELOP | DEVCLASS | * | Package access |
| S_DEVELOP | OBJTYPE | * | Object type access |
| S_DEVELOP | OBJNAME | * | Object name access |
| S_TCODE | TCD | SE80, SE38, SE01, SE09, SE10, SE11, STMS | Transaction code access |
| S_TRANSPRT | ACTVT | 01, 02, 03 | Transport management |
| S_TRANSPRT | TTYPE | * | Transport type access |
| S_RFC | ACTVT | 16 | RFC execution |
| S_RFC | RFC_TYPE | FUNC | Function module access |
| S_RFC | RFC_NAME | Z*, /GOOG/*, /MSFT/* | Function module pattern |
