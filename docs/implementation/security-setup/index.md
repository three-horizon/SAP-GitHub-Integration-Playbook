## Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure complete security setup:

- [ ] Microsoft Sentinel workspace configured
- [ ] Data connectors established for all components
- [ ] Analytics rules deployed and tested
- [ ] Microsoft Defender for Cloud enabled
- [ ] Security workbooks and dashboards created
- [ ] SOAR playbooks implemented
- [ ] GitHub Advanced Security configured
- [ ] Network security hardened
- [ ] Compliance standards verified

## Compliance and Governance

* [Regulatory Compliance](./regulatory-compliance.md) - Address regulatory requirements
* [Security Governance](./security-governance.md) - Establish security governance framework
* [Audit Configuration](./audit-setup.md) - Configure comprehensive auditing
* [Risk Assessment](./risk-assessment.md) - Perform security risk assessment
