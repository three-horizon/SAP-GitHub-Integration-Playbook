## ROI Calculation Methodology

When calculating return on investment, consider these benefit categories:

1. **Development Efficiency**
   - Reduced development cycle time
   - Increased developer productivity
   - Faster issue resolution
   - Improved code reuse

2. **Quality Improvements**
   - Reduced defect rates
   - Decreased production incidents
   - Faster mean time to resolution
   - Lower maintenance costs

3. **Process Automation**
   - Reduced manual effort
   - Decreased wait times
   - Lower operational overhead
   - Improved compliance management

4. **Business Agility**
   - Faster time-to-market
   - Improved innovation capacity
   - Enhanced ability to respond to change
   - Better alignment with business needs

Typical ROI calculation formula:
```
ROI = (Net Benefit / Total Cost) Ã— 100
```

Where Net Benefit = Total Benefits - Total Costs
