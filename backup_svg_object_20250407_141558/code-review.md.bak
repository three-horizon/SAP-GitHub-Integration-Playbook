## üìã Overview

This guide outlines the recommended code review processes for SAP development when using GitHub. Implementing effective code reviews is essential for maintaining code quality, ensuring knowledge sharing, and creating a collaborative development culture across SAP and GitHub environments.

## Setting Up Code Review Workflow

### Repository Configuration

Configure your GitHub repository for effective code reviews:

1. **Protected Branches**:
   - Main branch must be protected
   - Require pull requests before merging
   - Require review approvals (recommend at least 1-2 reviewers)
   - Enable status checks (ABAP syntax validation, unit tests)
   - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed

2. **CODEOWNERS File**:
   - Create a `CODEOWNERS` file in the `.github` directory:
   ```
   # Default owners for everything
   *       @sap-admin-team
   
   # ABAP domain owners
   src/z_financial_*       @finance-team
   src/z_sales_*           @sales-team
   src/z_logistics_*       @logistics-team
   
   # Infrastructure configuration
   .github/workflows/      @devops-team
   ```

3. **Pull Request Template**:
   - Create a `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file:
   ```markdown
   ## Description
   
   [Describe the changes and their purpose]
   
   ## Related Issues
   
   [Link to related issues or transport requests]
   
   ## Type of Change
   
   - [ ] Bug fix
   - [ ] New feature
   - [ ] Enhancement to existing functionality
   - [ ] Breaking change
   - [ ] Documentation update
   
   ## SAP Impact
   
   - [ ] Requires transport to QAS
   - [ ] Requires transport to PRD
   - [ ] Changes database structure
   - [ ] Affects authorization/security
   
   ## Test Plan
   
   [Describe how you tested these changes]
   
   ## Screenshots/SAP Output (if applicable)
   
   [Add screenshots or SAP output examples]
   
   ## Checklist
   
   - [ ] My code follows the project's coding standards
   - [ ] I have updated documentation as needed
   - [ ] All tests are passing
   - [ ] ABAP syntax check is successful
   - [ ] I have verified these changes in an SAP system
   ```

### Automated Checks

Implement these automated checks for SAP development:

1. **ABAP Linting**:
   - Configure abaplint with rules appropriate for your SAP version
   - Create a `.abaplint.json` file at the root of your repository
   - Run linting as part of your GitHub Actions workflow

2. **Unit Tests**:
   - Configure ABAP Unit test execution from GitHub Actions
   - Set minimum code coverage requirements (recommend starting with 60%)
   - Block merges if tests fail

3. **Transport Validation**:
   - Verify transport requests associated with code changes
   - Ensure proper sequencing for dependent changes
   - Validate object consistency across changes

## Code Review Guidelines

### For Code Authors

When submitting code for review:

1. **Prepare Clear Pull Requests**:
   - Keep PRs focused on a single logical change
   - Limit size to ~400 lines of code when possible
   - Break large changes into smaller, sequential PRs
   - Provide context and reasoning in the description

2. **Self-Review**:
   - Review your own changes before requesting reviews
   - Check for obvious issues, syntax errors, or typos
   - Verify all tests pass locally
   - Test changes in an SAP development system before pushing

3. **Respond to Feedback**:
   - Address all review comments
   - Explain your reasoning when disagreeing
   - Be open to suggestions and alternatives
   - Thank reviewers for their input

### For Code Reviewers

When reviewing SAP code:

1. **Technical Aspects**:
   - **ABAP Syntax**: Verify correct syntax for the SAP version
   - **Performance**: Check for inefficient database operations, nested loops
   - **Security**: Look for direct SQL, authority checks, input validation
   - **Error Handling**: Ensure proper exception handling
   - **Naming Conventions**: Follow SAP and organizational standards

2. **Business Logic**:
   - Verify implementation matches business requirements
   - Check edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Consider integration with other SAP modules
   - Verify transactional integrity

3. **SAP-Specific Considerations**:
   - Transport dependencies and sequencing
   - Backward compatibility with existing SAP functionality
   - Impact on standard SAP objects
   - Adherence to SAP development guidelines

4. **Review Approach**:
   - Be constructive and respectful
   - Focus on the code, not the developer
   - Provide specific, actionable feedback
   - Praise good solutions and patterns
   - Ask questions rather than making assumptions

## Code Review Workflow

### Standard Workflow

The typical code review process follows these steps:

1. **Development**:
   - Developer creates a feature branch from `main`
   - Implements changes in SAP system
   - Pushes changes to GitHub feature branch

2. **Pull Request Creation**:
   - Developer creates a pull request to `main`
   - Fills out the PR template with details
   - Assigns appropriate reviewers
   - Links related issues or transport requests

3. **Automated Checks**:
   - GitHub Actions run automated checks:
     - ABAP syntax validation
     - Unit tests
     - Code style checks
     - Transport validation

4. **Code Review**:
   - Reviewers examine the changes
   - Add comments and suggestions
   - Approve or request changes

5. **Revision**:
   - Developer addresses feedback
   - Pushes additional commits
   - Reviewers re-review changes

6. **Approval and Merge**:
   - After approval, the PR can be merged
   - The changes are incorporated into `main`
   - The feature branch can be deleted

### Emergency Fix Workflow

For urgent production issues:

1. **Hotfix Branch**:
   - Create a `hotfix/` branch directly from `main`
   - Implement the minimal necessary fix
   - Push changes to GitHub

2. **Expedited Review**:
   - Create a PR with "URGENT" in the title
   - Assign at least one senior reviewer
   - Provide clear context on the production issue

3. **Abbreviated Review**:
   - Focus review on correctness and potential side effects
   - Run critical automated checks
   - Approve and merge as soon as checks pass

4. **Post-Implementation Review**:
   - Conduct a more thorough review after the fix is deployed
   - Document any technical debt incurred
   - Create follow-up tasks for improvements

## Best Practices for SAP Code Reviews
