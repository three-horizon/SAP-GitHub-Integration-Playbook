   - Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
   - Payback period
   - Annual and cumulative cash flows
   - Benefit-to-cost ratio

3. Adjust the discount rate if needed to match your organization's standards

### Step 5: Perform Sensitivity Analysis

1. Navigate to the "Sensitivity Analysis" tab
2. Review the predefined scenarios:

   - Optimistic case
   - Extended implementation
   - Reduced adoption
   - Cost variations

3. Add custom scenarios if desired by modifying the adjustment factors

### Step 6: Review Executive Dashboard

1. Navigate to the "Executive Dashboard" tab
2. Review the automatically generated visualizations:
   - ROI summary
   - Cash flow chart
   - Benefit breakdown
   - Cost distribution
   - Sensitivity comparison
   - Payback timeline

3. Use the print function to create a PDF for executive presentations

## Tips for Accurate ROI Analysis

1. **Document Assumptions**: Record all assumptions in the "Assumptions" tab
2. **Involve Stakeholders**: Get input from finance, development, and operations teams
3. **Use Realistic Estimates**: Base estimates on industry benchmarks and organization data
4. **Include All Costs**: Account for hidden and indirect costs
5. **Be Conservative with Benefits**: Use the lower end of benefit ranges when uncertain
6. **Consider Phased Benefits**: Benefits typically increase over time as adoption grows
7. **Update Regularly**: Revisit the analysis as actual data becomes available

## Customizing the Spreadsheet

The spreadsheet can be customized to match your specific needs:

1. **Adding Rows**: Use the built-in functions to add custom cost or benefit items
2. **Changing Formulas**: All calculation cells are unlocked and can be modified
3. **Extending Analysis**: Add additional years by extending the formulas to the right
4. **Custom Visualizations**: Modify or add charts in the dashboard as needed

## Support and Feedback

If you encounter issues with the spreadsheet or have suggestions for improvement, please:

1. Verify that you are using the latest version of the template
2. Check the "Common Issues" section in the Instructions tab
3. Submit feedback through the project's issue tracker

## Comparing Results with Case Studies

After completing your analysis, compare your projected results with the case studies documented in the SAP-GitHub Integration Playbook to validate your estimates.
