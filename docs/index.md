## Introduction

The SAP-GitHub Integration Playbook documentation provides comprehensive guidance for implementing and maintaining integrations between SAP systems and GitHub. This documentation is designed to support technical teams throughout the entire integration lifecycle - from initial planning to daily operations and maintenance.

Our goal is to provide a clear, structured path to successful integration that addresses the specific needs of different SAP system types while leveraging GitHub's powerful collaboration features.

1. **For Business Decision Makers**: Begin with the [Executive Overview](./executive-overview.md) to understand ROI, business benefits, and implementation requirements.

2. **For Project Managers**: Review the [Implementation Plan](./getting-started/implementation-plan.md) and [Implementation Checklist](./getting-started/implementation-checklist.md) to plan your project.

3. **For Architects**: Explore the [Architecture Documentation](./documentation/architecture/index.md) to understand system design and integration patterns.

4. **For Implementation Teams**: Follow the detailed [Implementation Guides](./documentation/guides/index.md) for step-by-step instructions.

6. **For Operations Teams**: Refer to the [Operations Documentation](./documentation/operations/README.md) for maintenance and support procedures.

## Implementation Journey

This playbook provides a sequential, step-by-step approach to implementing the SAP-GitHub integration. Each tutorial builds directly on the previous ones, creating a continuous implementation journey.

### Core Implementation Path

Follow these tutorials in sequence to implement the foundational SAP-GitHub integration:

2. **[Tutorial 2: Configuring abapGit for Your Project](./3-setup-guide/configure-abapgit.md)** (Steps 32-65)
   - Create an ABAP package for your project
   - Set up a corresponding GitHub repository
   - Connect your SAP package to GitHub
   - Push your first ABAP program to GitHub

3. **[Tutorial 3: Implementing Development Workflow](./4-workflow-tutorials/development-workflow.md)** (Steps 66-110)
   - Create feature branches for development
   - Implement features in SAP
   - Commit and push changes to GitHub
