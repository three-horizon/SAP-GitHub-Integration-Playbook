# Community Support Model

This guide outlines how to establish and maintain a Community of Excellence (CoE) structure for supporting SAP-GitHub integration across the enterprise.

## üìã Overview

A Community Support Model combines centralized expertise with distributed knowledge sharing to provide sustainable, scalable support for SAP-GitHub integration. This approach balances formal support structures with community-led assistance to maximize knowledge sharing and adoption.
