     4. If unresolvable, contact Basis team
     ```

3. **Code Quality Issues**:
   - ATC findings
   - SCI warnings
   - Performance concerns
   - Example resolution process:
     ```
     ATC Findings:
     1. Review findings by priority
     2. Address critical and high issues first

### Best Practices

1. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Follow ABAP clean code guidelines
   - Use meaningful naming
   - Write comprehensive documentation
   - Implement thorough testing
   - Example clean code principles:
     ```
     - Methods should do one thing
     - Limit method size (50 lines maximum)
     - Use meaningful variable names
     - Document public interfaces
     - Follow consistent formatting
     - Avoid SELECT * and nested loops
     ```

2. **Repository Management**
   - Keep repositories focused
   - Maintain clean branch structure
   - Use conventional commit messages
   - Archive inactive branches
   - Example branch strategy:
     ```
     - main: Production-ready code
     - develop: Integration branch
     - feature/*: New features
     - fix/*: Bug fixes
     - release/*: Release preparation
     - hotfix/*: Emergency fixes for production
     ```

3. **Security Practices**
   - Never commit secrets
   - Implement proper authorization checks
   - Validate all inputs
   - Follow secure development guidelines
   - Example security principles:
     ```
     - Implement AUTHORITY-CHECK before sensitive operations
     - Use parameterized queries (avoid dynamic WHERE clauses)
     - Sanitize user inputs
     - Follow least privilege principle
     - Never hardcode credentials
     ```

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize database access
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Consider resource constraints
   - Test with realistic data volumes
   - Example performance guidelines:
     ```
     - Use SELECT with specific fields (not SELECT *)
     - Avoid nested SELECTs in loops
     - Use appropriate indexes
     - Implement read buffering for reference data
     - Process data in chunks for large volumes
     ```
