### Phase 3: Visual Enhancement

- Create SVG diagrams for all key flows
- Develop executive dashboard visuals
- Add architecture diagrams
- Create implementation decision trees

### Phase 4: Review and Validation

- Technical review of all content
- Navigation testing
- Consistency validation
- Content completeness verification

## Migration Instructions

To complete the migration process:

1. Run the migration script to set up the directory structure:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/migrate-documentation.sh
   ```

2. For each file in the old structure that needs to be migrated:
   - Copy the file to the appropriate location in the new structure
   - Apply the document template format
   - Update internal links to use the new structure
   - Verify document metadata
   - Add appropriate navigation aids

3. For new content development:
   - Use the document template as a starting point
   - Follow the established heading structure
   - Include proper navigation aids
   - Add document metadata

## ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps

1. Complete migration of remaining documentation
2. Develop content for Executive Overview section
3. Create SVG diagrams for architecture and flows
4. Update internal links throughout documentation
5. Validate the restructured documentation

## Conclusion

The documentation restructuring follows the proposed plan and provides a solid foundation for a comprehensive, user-friendly documentation experience. The role-based structure with progressive knowledge building ensures that different stakeholders can quickly find the information most relevant to their needs.

Completing the remaining items will result in a fully transformed documentation set that enhances the value of the SAP-GitHub Integration Playbook.
