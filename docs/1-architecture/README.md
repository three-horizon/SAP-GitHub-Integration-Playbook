## 📋 Overview

This section contains the comprehensive architectural details of the SAP-GitHub integration. The architecture documentation provides system design blueprints, component relationships, data flow patterns, integration interfaces, and design decisions that form the foundation of the entire integration.

## 🧩 Components

The SAP-GitHub integration architecture consists of several key components:

- **SAP Systems** - ECC, S/4HANA, BTP components
- **GitHub Components** - Repositories, Actions, APIs
- **Integration Middleware** - API gateways, connectors
- **Security Components** - Authentication, authorization

Detailed information about each component can be found in:
- [System Architecture](./system-architecture.md)
- [SAP Components](./sap-components.md)
- [Integration Architecture](./integration-architecture.md)

## 🔄 Integration Patterns

The integration between SAP and GitHub follows several established patterns:

| Pattern | Use Case | Documentation |
|:--------|:---------|:--------------|
| Direct API Integration | Real-time synchronization | [API Extension Framework](./api-extension-framework.md) |
| Event-Based Integration | Asynchronous updates | [Event Architecture](./integration-architecture.md) |
| File-Based Integration | Large data transfers | [abapGit Architecture](./sap-abap-architecture.md) |

For a complete guide to integration patterns, see [Integration Architecture](./integration-architecture.md).

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

The security architecture ensures:

1. Proper authentication between systems
2. Authorization for actions
3. Data protection during transit and at rest
4. Audit trails for all integration activities

Key security documents:
- [Governance Model](./governance-model.md)
- [Security Architecture](./security-architecture.md)
