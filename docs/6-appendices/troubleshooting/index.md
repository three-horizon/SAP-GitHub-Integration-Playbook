## Integration Connectivity Issues

### Unable to Connect to GitHub from SAP

| Problem | Symptoms | Potential Causes |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| SAP system cannot connect to GitHub | abapGit connection errors, HTTP error codes | Network restrictions, proxy configuration, SSL certificate issues |

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Check network connectivity from SAP to GitHub
   ```bash
   # From SAP server
   ping github.com
   curl -v https://api.github.com
   ```
2. Verify SSL certificate trust in SAP
   - Transaction STRUST to check certificate trust
   - Transaction SMICM to check HTTP client settings

3. Check proxy configuration
   - Transaction SMICM → Go to → Services → HTTP → HTTP Connections

**Resolution:**
1. Configure proper proxy settings
   ```abap
   " In ABAP code for HTTP client
   lo_http_client->propertytype_logon_popup = if_http_client=>co_disabled.
   lo_http_client->propertytype_set_proxy(
     proxy_host = 'your.proxy.server'
     proxy_port = proxy_port
   ).
   ```

2. Import GitHub certificates to STRUST
3. Adjust network firewall rules to allow traffic to GitHub domains
