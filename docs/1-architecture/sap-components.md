# SAP Components Overview

This document provides an overview of the SAP technologies covered in this integration playbook, focusing on their specific requirements and integration patterns with GitHub.

## SAP Technology Landscape

The integration playbook addresses the following core SAP technologies:

- SAP ERP (ABAP Traditional)
- SAP CRM
- SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)
- SAP Fiori and UI5 Applications
- SAP HANA Applications

Each technology requires specialized integration approaches due to their unique architectures, development models, and deployment patterns.

## Common Integration Patterns

While each SAP technology has specific requirements, several common integration patterns are applicable across all technologies:

1. **Source Code Management**
   - Bidirectional synchronization with GitHub
   - Change tracking and versioning
   - Branch management aligned with SAP landscapes

2. **Continuous Integration**
   - Automated build process
   - Static code analysis
   - Automated testing
   - Security scanning

3. **Continuous Delivery**
   - Transport/deployment automation
   - Environment-specific configuration
   - Release management
   - Rollback mechanisms

4. **Security & Governance**
   - Access control integration
   - Audit trail preservation
   - Compliance validation
   - Policy enforcement

## Technology-Specific Integration Considerations

### SAP ERP (ABAP Traditional)

Traditional ABAP development in SAP ERP systems presents unique integration challenges due to its centralized development environment and transport-based deployment model.

#### Key Integration Points

- ABAP source code extraction and injection
- Transport request integration
- Development object locking
- System-specific configurations
- Table-driven customization

#### Integration Architectures

- **With CHARM:** Leverages SAP's Change Request Management for transport automation
- **Without CHARM:** Requires custom RFC-based integration for transport management

See [SAP ABAP Architecture](./sap-abap-architecture.md) for detailed ABAP-specific integration patterns.

### SAP CRM

SAP CRM systems introduce additional integration requirements related to customer-facing applications and specialized business processes.

#### Key Integration Points

- Business configuration management
- UI personalization
- Web UI components
- Integration with external systems
- Industry-specific components

See [CRM Architecture](./crm-architecture.md) for CRM-specific integration patterns.

### SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)

SAP BTP provides cloud-based development environments that require cloud-native integration approaches.

#### Key Integration Points

- Cloud Foundry application deployment
- Destination service configuration
- Service instance management
- Multi-cloud deployment
- API management

See [BTP Architecture](./btp-architecture.md) for BTP-specific integration patterns.

### SAP Fiori and UI5 Applications

Modern SAP user interfaces built with Fiori and UI5 technologies require frontend-focused integration approaches.

#### Key Integration Points

- Frontend build pipelines
- Launchpad configuration
- Theme management
- Application variant management
- Translation handling

See [Fiori/UI5 Architecture](./fiori-ui5-architecture.md) for Fiori/UI5-specific integration patterns.

### SAP HANA Applications

SAP HANA applications leverage the in-memory database platform and often involve specialized development models.

#### Key Integration Points

- HDI container deployment
- Calculation view management
- SQL script versioning
- Performance optimization
- Data modeling

See [HANA Architecture](./hana-architecture.md) for HANA-specific integration patterns.
