This document outlines the specialized architecture for integrating SAP HANA application development with GitHub Enterprise, addressing the unique requirements of developing and deploying applications that leverage the SAP HANA database platform.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

SAP HANA applications utilize the in-memory database platform's unique capabilities and often involve specialized development models including XS Classic, XS Advanced (Cloud Foundry-based), and native SQLScript development. Integrating GitHub with SAP HANA development requires specialized approaches that address these models while providing modern DevOps capabilities.

## Architecture Components

The HANA integration architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **SAP HANA Development Environment** - Development tools for HANA applications
2. **GitHub Enterprise** - Source code repository and collaboration platform
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Services** - Continuous integration and deployment services
4. **HDI Container Management** - HANA Deployment Infrastructure components
5. **Database Artifact Versioning** - Specialized versioning for database objects
6. **Testing Framework** - Database-specific testing components
7. **Performance Monitoring** - HANA-specific performance analysis tools

## HANA-Specific Integration Requirements

### XS Classic Integration Patterns

SAP HANA XS Classic is the original application server embedded within SAP HANA. Although newer development should use XS Advanced or other approaches, many organizations maintain legacy XS Classic applications that require modern DevOps practices.

#### XS Classic Architecture

    A[Developer] -->|Modify| B[XS Classic Repository]
    B -->|Export to| C[File System]
    C -->|Commit to| D[GitHub Repository]
    D -->|Trigger| E[CI/CD Pipeline]
    E -->|Validate| F[XS Classic Validator]
    F -->|Deploy to| G[Target HANA System]
    H[XS Classic Delivery Unit] -->|Package| G
    I[GitHub Actions] -->|Orchestrate| E
```

#### XS Classic Development Objects

XS Classic applications typically include the following object types:

| Object Type | File Extension | Purpose | Special Handling |
|------------|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| JavaScript Files | .js, .xsjs | Server-side application logic | Static analysis, security scanning |
| OData Services | .xsodata | OData service definitions | Service validation, entity verification |
| XSJS Services | .xsjslib | Reusable JavaScript libraries | Dependency analysis |
| HANA Views | .hdbview | Database views | SQL validation, dependency analysis |
| HANA Procedures | .hdbprocedure | Database procedures | SQL validation, security analysis |
| Web Content | .html, .css | Browser UI elements | Content validation |
| Package Structure | .xsapp, .xsaccess | Application configuration | Configuration validation |

#### XS Classic Export and Import

The primary integration challenge with XS Classic is that code is stored within the HANA repository, requiring specialized export and import processes:

1. **Repository Export Process**
   - Export of XS Classic content to file system
   - Directory structure preservation
   - Metadata extraction

2. **Version Control Integration**
   - Commit of exported content to GitHub
   - Branch management for parallel development
   - Merge conflict resolution strategies

3. **Delivery Unit Management**
   - Creation of delivery units from GitHub content
   - Version management of delivery units
   - Transport across systems

4. **Import Process**
   - Import of content into target HANA systems
   - Activation of imported objects
   - Validation of successful activation

#### GitHub Actions for XS Classic

Example GitHub Actions workflow for XS Classic:

```yaml

### Database Artifact Versioning Approaches

SAP HANA database artifacts require specialized versioning approaches to handle schema evolution and dependency management.

#### Versioning Challenges

Database artifacts present unique versioning challenges:

3. **Stateful Objects**
   - Tables with persistent data
   - Configuration objects
   - Schema-bound objects

4. **Performance Impacts**
   - Index changes
   - Statistics requirements
   - Query plan implications

#### Versioning Strategies

Several versioning strategies can be employed:

1. **Schema-Based Versioning**

   - Parallel schema versions during migration
   - Schema synchronization tools

2. **Delta-Based Deployment**
   - Incremental change scripts
   - Automated delta generation
   - Change log tracking

3. **Object-Level Versioning**
   - Object naming with version indicators
   - View compatibility layers
   - Procedure versioning

4. **Migration Framework**

   - Data validation tools
   - Rollback capabilities

#### Versioning Configuration

Example schema versioning configuration:

```yaml
# schema-version.yaml
schemaVersions:
  current: v5
  previous:
    - v4
    - v3
    
compatibilityViews:
  - name: CUSTOMER_V3
    implementation: CUSTOMER_V5
    compatibility: v3
    
  - name: CUSTOMER_V4
    implementation: CUSTOMER_V5
    compatibility: v4
    
migrationScripts:
  - source: v3
    target: v4
    script: migrations/v3_to_v4.hdbprocedure
    
  - source: v4
    target: v5
    script: migrations/v4_to_v5.hdbprocedure
```
