## ðŸ“‹ Overview
This document outlines the process for identifying, fixing, and preventing documentation issues, particularly focusing on broken links (404 errors) and incomplete documentation.

## Analysis Process

### 1. Repository Scanning
- Run the automated link checker: `./scripts/check-broken-links.sh`
- Review the generated report in `reports/broken-links.json`
- Document each found issue in the issue tracker with appropriate labels

### 2. Issue Classification
For each identified issue, classify by:
- **Severity**: Critical (blocks user progress), Major (significantly impacts understanding), Minor (cosmetic or non-essential)
- **Type**: Broken link, Missing document, Incomplete content, Outdated information
- **Location**: Core documentation, API reference, Tutorials, Examples, README

## Remediation Workflow

### 1. Issue Assignment
- Assign issues based on expertise and priority
- Critical issues should be addressed within 3 business days
- Major issues should be addressed within 7 business days

### 2. Content Creation
When creating missing documentation:
- Use the appropriate template from `templates/documentation/`
- Research relevant information from internal resources first
- If external references are needed, properly cite sources
- Follow the [Documentation Style Guide](../documentation-style-guide.md) for consistent writing

### 3. Content Review
- Submit documentation changes via pull request
- Each PR should reference the issue it addresses
- At least one technical reviewer and one documentation specialist should review
- Run the link checker locally before submitting: `./scripts/check-broken-links.sh`

## Prevention Measures

### Automated Checks
- CI pipeline includes link checking for all PRs
- Failed link checks block PR merging

### Documentation Templates
- All new documentation should use the appropriate template
- Minimum content requirements are enforced through PR reviews

### Regular Audits
- Full documentation review conducted quarterly
- Automated link checking run weekly with issues automatically created

## Validation Process

### Testing Procedure
- After fixing documentation issues, validate by:
  1. Running the link checker
  2. Manual navigation through the documentation
  3. Testing examples and code snippets

### Success Criteria
- Zero broken links
- All referenced documents exist and have substantial content
- Examples are working and up-to-date

## Reporting

### Remediation Metrics
- Number of issues identified and fixed
- Average time to resolution
- Distribution of issue types
- Recurring problem areas

### Documentation Health Score
- Percentage of documents with all required sections
- Percentage of links functioning correctly
- User feedback ratings
