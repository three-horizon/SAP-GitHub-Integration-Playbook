## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This document provides guidance for upgrading the components of the SAP-GitHub integration environment. It covers upgrade planning, procedures, testing strategies, and rollback procedures to ensure smooth version transitions with minimal disruption to development activities.

## Upgrade Planning

### Component Version Compatibility

| Component | Current Version | Target Version | Comments |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| SAP NetWeaver | 7.5x | 7.5x with latest SP | Regular SP upgrades maintain compatibility |
| abapGit | v1.x | v1.y (latest stable) | Minor version upgrades are generally safe |
| GitHub Enterprise | 3.x | 3.y (latest) | Ensure API compatibility is maintained |
| GitHub Actions | N/A | Latest | Runner versions should match workflow needs |
| Integration Middleware | Custom | Custom with updates | Follow middleware-specific upgrade paths |

### Pre-Upgrade Assessment

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - Document current versions of all components
   - Identify customizations and extensions
   - Review integration points and dependencies
   - Assess current performance and issues

2. **Impact Analysis**:
   - Review release notes for all components
   - Identify breaking changes and deprecations
   - Assess impact on custom extensions
   - Evaluate resource requirements for upgrade

3. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Identify potential upgrade risks
   - Develop mitigation strategies
   - Create contingency plans
   - Plan rollback procedures

### Upgrade Strategy

1. **Phased Approach**:
   - Upgrade development environment first
   - Proceed to QA after successful testing

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Develop comprehensive test plan
   - Create test scripts for critical functions
   - Plan for regression testing
   - Prepare performance test scenarios

3. **Rollback Planning**:
   - Document rollback procedures for each component
   - Create restoration points
   - Establish rollback decision criteria
   - Assign responsibilities for go/no-go decisions
