## Introduction

This architecture documentation provides a comprehensive technical foundation for implementing SAP-GitHub integration. The architecture is designed to address the unique requirements of different SAP systems while leveraging GitHub's collaborative features and modern DevOps capabilities.

Our architecture enables:

- Secure, bidirectional code flow between SAP systems and GitHub
- Automated CI/CD workflows for SAP development
- Context preservation across development environments
- Comprehensive security and governance
- Scalability for enterprise-wide adoption

## Architectural Principles

The SAP-GitHub integration architecture is guided by these core principles:

### 1. Security by Design
- All integration points are secured with appropriate authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive audit logging and monitoring
- Least privilege access controls
- Secure transport and data handling

### 2. Enterprise Scalability
- Support for multiple SAP landscapes and GitHub organizations
- Performance optimization for large codebases
- Horizontal scaling for high-volume environments
- Resource efficiency for operational sustainability

### 3. Defense in Depth
- Multiple security layers throughout the architecture
- No single point of failure
- Resilient to component failures
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

### 4. Separation of Concerns
- Modular component design
- Clear interface definitions
- Independent scaling of components
- Isolation of critical systems

### 5. Standards Compliance
- Adherence to SAP and GitHub best practices
- Compliance with industry security standards
- Support for regulatory requirements
- Documentation of compliance controls

## High-Level Architecture

The SAP-GitHub integration consists of five primary architectural layers:

  <img src="../../../assets/images/architecture/high-level-architecture.svg" width="800" alt="SAP-GitHub Architecture Layers">
</div>

1. **SAP Systems Layer**: The SAP environments where application development occurs, including:
   - SAP ABAP systems (ECC, S/4HANA)
   - SAP BTP environments
   - SAP CRM and other business applications
   - SAP Fiori/UI5 applications
   - SAP HANA native applications

2. **Integration Layer**: Middleware components that facilitate secure communication:
   - API Management for controlled access
   - Event brokers for asynchronous communication
   - Context store for development context preservation
   - Transport integration for automated release management

3. **GitHub Layer**: GitHub Enterprise components including:
   - GitHub repositories for version control
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
   - GitHub Apps for extended functionality
   - GitHub Advanced Security for code scanning

4. **Security Layer**: Comprehensive security controls:
   - Authentication services (OAuth, JWT)
   - Authorization management
   - Secret management
   - Audit logging and compliance monitoring

5. **Monitoring Layer**: End-to-end visibility components:
   - Operational monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   - Security monitoring
   - Developer analytics

## Integration Patterns

The architecture supports multiple integration patterns to address different requirements:

### Pattern 1: Direct Integration

<div align="center">
  <img src="../../../assets/images/architecture/abapgit-workflow.svg" width="800" alt="Direct Integration via abapGit">

  *Direct integration using abapGit*
</div>

This pattern uses abapGit to directly connect SAP ABAP systems to GitHub repositories:

- Lightweight implementation with minimal middleware
- Suitable for smaller implementations or pilot projects
- Limited automation capabilities
- Basic authentication and security

**Documentation:** [SAP ABAP Architecture](./sap-abap-architecture.md)

### Pattern 2: API-Mediated Integration

<div align="center">
  <img src="../../../assets/images/architecture/api-extension-framework.svg" width="800" alt="API-Mediated Integration">

  *API-mediated integration using API management*
</div>

This pattern uses API Management to broker communications between SAP systems and GitHub:

- Enhanced security with API policies
- Advanced authentication options
- Comprehensive monitoring and throttling
- Support for multiple SAP systems

**Documentation:** [API Extension Framework](./api-extension-framework.md)

### Pattern 3: Event-Driven Integration
