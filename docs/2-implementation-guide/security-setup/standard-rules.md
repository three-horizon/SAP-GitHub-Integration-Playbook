- Data connectors configured and collecting data:
  - Azure Activity
  - Azure AD
  - GitHub Enterprise
  - SAP logs
  - Integration component logs
- Appropriate permissions to create and modify analytics rules
- Understanding of KQL query language
- Familiarity with MITRE ATT&CK framework

## Best Practices

1. **Rule Development**
   - Test rules in development environment
   - Use small time windows for initial testing
   - Validate against known scenarios
   - Implement version control for queries
   - Document detection logic
   - Create response procedures

2. **Alert Quality**
   - Focus on actionable alerts
   - Include context with each alert
   - Provide clear remediation steps
   - Avoid alert fatigue
   - Assign appropriate severity
   - Link to knowledge base

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Review rule effectiveness
   - Track false positive rates
   - Update based on threat intelligence
   - Incorporate user feedback
   - Stay current with attack techniques
   - Regularly test detection coverage

4. **Documentation**
   - Maintain rule inventory
   - Document rule dependencies
   - Create runbooks for each rule
   - Document tuning history
   - Track rule performance metrics
   - Create rule change log

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Rule Not Triggering**:
  - Verify data source connectivity
  - Check query syntax
  - Confirm appropriate time ranges
  - Validate threshold settings
  - Test query independently
  - Check for data format changes

- **Excessive Alerts**:
  - Adjust thresholds
  - Implement additional filtering
  - Create suppression rules
  - Use entity allowlisting
  - Consider time window changes
  - Implement aggregation logic

- **Performance Issues**:
  - Optimize query efficiency
  - Reduce data scope where possible
  - Use appropriate functions
  - Consider materialized views
  - Adjust rule frequency
  - Monitor resource utilization
