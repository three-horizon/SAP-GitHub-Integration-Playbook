This tutorial provides comprehensive guidance on how to effectively manage pull requests in the SAP-GitHub integration workflow, ensuring quality code and smooth transport management.

## üìã Overview

Pull requests (PRs) are a critical component of the GitHub workflow, enabling code review, automated validation, and collaborative development. When applied to SAP development, pull requests:

- Facilitate systematic code reviews for ABAP and other SAP artifacts
- Enforce quality gates before code is merged
- Provide traceability between code changes and business requirements
- Ensure SAP transport validation before changes are promoted
- Create an audit trail for compliance purposes
- Encourage knowledge sharing and team collaboration

This tutorial guides you through the complete PR lifecycle for SAP development, from creation to merge and beyond.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] A GitHub repository set up for SAP development (see [Setting Up Your First SAP-GitHub Repository](../basic/first-repository.md))
- [ ] Branch protection rules configured (see [Configuring Branch Protection Rules](../basic/branch-protection.md))
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows established (see [Setting Up GitHub Actions Workflows](../basic/github-actions-setup.md))
- [ ] Experience working with feature branches (see [Working with Feature Branches](./feature-branches.md))
- [ ] abapGit installed and configured in your SAP system

## Step 1: Understanding the Pull Request Workflow for SAP

In the SAP-GitHub integration context, the PR workflow typically follows these steps:

1. Developer creates a feature branch and transport request
2. Developer implements changes in SAP and pushes to the feature branch
3. Developer creates a pull request targeting the development branch
4. Automated checks validate the SAP transport and ABAP syntax
5. Code reviewers evaluate the changes
6. Developer addresses any feedback
7. PR is approved and merged
8. SAP transport is automatically released to QAS
9. Feature branch is deleted

Understanding this workflow is essential for effective PR management.

## Step 2: Preparing to Create a Pull Request

Before creating a PR, ensure your changes are ready for review:

1. **Complete your SAP development**:
   - Ensure all objects are activated in your DEV system
   - Run any relevant unit tests
   - Verify functionality works as expected
   - Check for any syntax warnings or errors

2. **Prepare your transport**:
   - All changes should be in the same transport request
   - Record the transport number for reference
   - Ensure the transport is not released yet

3. **Update documentation** if your changes require it:
   - Update any relevant README files
   - Add or update technical documentation
   - Include these documentation changes in your PR

4. **Push final changes** to your feature branch:
   - In SAP, use transaction `/GOOG/ZGIT_DEV` (or your custom transaction)
   - Select your package
   - Specify your feature branch
   - Push to GitHub with a meaningful commit message

## Step 3: Creating a Pull Request

To create a pull request:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Pull requests** in the top menu
3. Click **New pull request**
4. Set **base** branch to the target (typically `develop` or `main`)
5. Set **compare** branch to your feature branch
6. Click **Create pull request**
7. Complete the PR template with the following information:
   - **Title**: Concise description of the change (e.g., "Add customer address validation")
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation of your changes
   - **Transport Request**: Include in the format `[TRANSPORT:DEVK900123]`
   - **Related Issues**: Link to any relevant issues using `#issue-number`
   - **Testing**: Describe testing performed
   - **Screenshots**: Add if relevant
   - **Checklist**: Complete all applicable items

8. Assign appropriate reviewers
9. Click **Create pull request**

## Step 4: Understanding Automated Checks

After creating your PR, automated checks will run:

1. **ABAP Syntax Validation**:
   - Checks ABAP code for syntax issues
   - Enforces coding standards
   - Reports any violations as comments on the PR

2. **Transport Validation**:
   - Verifies the transport exists in SAP
   - Checks transport content integrity
   - Validates that objects are properly activated
   - Ensures transport dependencies are met

3. **Other Checks** may include:
   - Unit test execution
   - Code coverage analysis
   - Custom validation rules

Review the status of these checks in the PR interface. If any fail, address the issues before proceeding.

## Step 5: Reviewing and Responding to Feedback

The code review process is critical for quality:

1. **Receiving feedback**:
   - Reviewers will examine your code and provide comments
   - Pay close attention to all feedback
   - Engage constructively with reviewers

2. **Addressing feedback**:
   - Make necessary changes in your SAP system
   - Use the same transport request
   - Push updates to your feature branch
   - The PR will automatically update with the new changes
   - Respond to each comment indicating how it was addressed

3. **Iterative improvement**:
   - Continue addressing feedback until reviewers are satisfied
   - Run automated checks again after each update
   - Keep the PR focused on a single feature or fix

## Step 6: Handling PR Approvals

Pull request approval follows these steps:

1. **Approval requirements**:
   - Branch protection rules determine required approvals (typically 1-2)
   - All automated checks must pass
   - All review comments must be resolved

2. **Obtaining approvals**:
   - Reviewers approve by clicking "Approve" in the GitHub interface
   - Required approvals appear in the PR status section
   - If changes are pushed after an approval, the approval may be dismissed

3. **Final checks before merge**:
   - Ensure all required approvals are in place
   - Verify all automated checks have passed
   - Confirm all conversation threads are resolved
   - Make sure the branch is up to date with the target branch

## Step 7: Merging the Pull Request

When ready to merge:

1. Click the **Merge pull request** button
2. Select the appropriate merge method:
   - **Create a merge commit** (default): Preserves all commits in feature branch
   - **Squash and merge**: Combines all commits into one (often preferred for SAP)
   - **Rebase and merge**: Applies changes without a merge commit

3. Update the commit message with:
   - Clear summary of changes
   - Reference to the PR number (`#123`)
   - Transport number (`DEVK900123`)

4. Click **Confirm merge**

## Step 8: Post-Merge Transport Management

After merging, the SAP transport workflow continues:

1. **Automated transport release**:
   - GitHub Actions workflow extracts the transport number
   - Transport is automatically released to QAS system
   - PR is updated with the transport status

2. **QAS testing**:
   - Test the changes in the QAS system
   - Ensure functionality works as expected
   - Report any issues in a new GitHub issue

3. **Production release** (when ready):
   - Create a production release PR or
   - Use a manual or scheduled workflow to release to PRD

## Step 9: Documentation and Cleanup

After successful merge:

1. **Update documentation** if necessary:
   - Mark related issues as resolved
   - Update project tracking tools
   - Add to release notes if applicable

2. **Clean up**:
   - Delete the feature branch (often automated)
   - Close any related issues
   - Update your local repository:
     ```sh
     git checkout develop
     git pull origin develop
     git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
     ```

## Special Pull Request Scenarios

### Handling Large Changes

For PRs containing extensive changes:

1. **Break into smaller PRs** if possible:
   - Create separate PRs for logical components
   - Create a tracking issue for the overall feature
   - Link all related PRs to the tracking issue

2. **If a large PR is unavoidable**:
   - Provide detailed documentation
   - Consider creating a high-level design document
   - Request incremental reviews focusing on specific areas

### Managing Dependent Pull Requests

When PRs depend on each other:

1. **Create PRs in the correct order**:
   - Create and merge dependent PRs first
   - Reference dependent PRs in the description (`Depends on #123`)

2. **Base branches appropriately**:
   - Base dependent PRs on the main development branch
   - Base follow-up PRs on the dependent PR's branch if needed

### Handling Urgent Fixes

For critical bug fixes:

1. **Create a hotfix branch** directly from the main branch
2. Implement the fix and create a transport request
3. Create a PR with the `[URGENT]` prefix in the title
4. Request expedited review
5. After merge, cherry-pick the fix to the development branch if needed

## Best Practices for SAP Pull Requests

1. **Keep PRs focused and small**:
   - One feature or fix per PR
   - Ideally less than 500 lines of changes
   - Clearly defined scope

2. **Write informative descriptions**:
   - Explain the "why" not just the "what"
   - Include testing instructions
   - List affected SAP functionality
   - Reference related documentation

3. **Include SAP-specific details**:
   - Transport number(s) in standard format
   - SAP package/module affected
   - Dependent objects or transports
   - Testing performed in the SAP system

4. **Facilitate efficient reviews**:
   - Highlight complex areas needing careful review
   - Provide context for SAP-specific logic
   - Explain non-obvious design decisions
   - Respond promptly to review comments

5. **Follow up after merge**:
   - Verify successful transport to QAS
   - Add comments with QAS testing results
   - Document any issues discovered post-merge

## Validation

Your PR management process is successful when:

- All code changes are properly reviewed before merge
- Transport validation ensures SAP objects are correctly handled
- Transport releases align with code merges
- Code quality improves through the review process
- Knowledge is shared among team members
- The process creates an audit trail for compliance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Automated checks failing | Review error logs and fix underlying issues in SAP |
| PR cannot be merged | Ensure all required approvals and checks are complete |
| Transport not found | Verify transport number and format in PR description |
| Merge conflicts | Update your branch with the latest development branch and resolve conflicts |
| Post-merge transport issues | Check SAP transport logs and create a fix-forward PR if needed |

### Special Cases

1. **Reverting a PR**:
   - Use GitHub's "Revert" button to create a new PR
   - Create a new transport request for the reversion
   - Follow the standard review process

2. **Cherry-picking changes**:
   - Create a new branch and PR for the cherry-pick
   - Reference the original PR
   - Create a new transport for these changes
