     </tr>
   </table>

5. **Residual Risk Calculation**
   - **Formula**: Residual Risk = Risk Level √ó (1 - Control Effectiveness %)
   - **Example**: High risk (12) with Effective controls (80% effective) = 12 √ó (1 - 0.8) = 2.4 (Low residual risk)
   - **Decision Matrix**:
     - Critical Residual Risk (15-25): Requires immediate remediation
     - High Residual Risk (10-14): Requires prompt remediation
     - Medium Residual Risk (5-9): Requires planned remediation
     - Low Residual Risk (3-4): Monitor and review periodically
     - Very Low Residual Risk (1-2): Accept and review annually
