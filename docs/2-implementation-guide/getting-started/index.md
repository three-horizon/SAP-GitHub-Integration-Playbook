# Getting Started with SAP-GitHub Integration

This section provides the essential information needed to begin your SAP-GitHub integration journey.

## Introduction

SAP-GitHub integration brings modern DevOps practices to SAP development, enabling:

- Version control for SAP code and configurations
- Collaborative development with pull requests and code reviews
- Automated testing and continuous integration
- Streamlined deployments and release management
- Enhanced code quality and governance

## üîß Implementation Approach

We recommend a phased approach to SAP-GitHub integration:

1. **Discovery Phase** - Understand current workflows and define requirements
2. **Pilot Phase** - Implement with a small team and focused scope
3. **Expansion Phase** - Roll out to additional teams and use cases
4. **Optimization Phase** - Refine processes and enhance automation
