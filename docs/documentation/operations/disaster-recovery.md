# Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity Planning

This guide provides a comprehensive approach to implementing disaster recovery (DR) and business continuity planning (BCP) for SAP-GitHub integrated environments.

## üìã Overview

A robust disaster recovery and business continuity plan ensures that your SAP-GitHub integration can survive disruptions ranging from minor system outages to major disasters. This guide outlines strategies, architectures, and implementation steps for creating a resilient integrated environment.

## Disaster Recovery Fundamentals

### Key Concepts

1. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**
   - Maximum acceptable data loss measured in time
   - Determines backup frequency and replication requirements
   - Varies by component and criticality
   - Typically measured in minutes to hours

2. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**
   - Maximum acceptable downtime for system restoration
   - Drives infrastructure and process design
   - Varies by component and business impact
   - Typically measured in hours to days

3. **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**
   - Assessment of outage consequences
   - Prioritization of systems and components
   - Financial impact quantification
   - Operational dependencies mapping

4. **Disaster Recovery vs. Business Continuity**
   - **DR**: Technical recovery of systems and data
   - **BCP**: Broader organizational response including processes, people, and communication
   - Both are required for comprehensive resilience
   - Integration points require special consideration
