## üìã Overview

This checklist guides you through the setup of your SAP system for integration with GitHub. It covers all the necessary steps to prepare your SAP environment, including system verification, technical user setup, SAP Notes installation, and gateway configuration.

## How to Use This Checklist

This interactive checklist helps you track your implementation progress. Check off items as you complete them:

- [ ] Uncompleted task
- [x] Completed task

You can copy this checklist to your own tracking document or project management tool to maintain your progress.

## Phase 1: Preparation

- [ ] Verify SAP system compatibility (S/4 HANA or ECC 6.0 EHP 7+)
- [ ] Document current SAP landscape configuration (DEV, QAS, PRD)
- [ ] Ensure SAP_BASIS 7.40 or higher is installed
- [ ] Review and document current transport management processes
- [ ] Identify team members responsible for SAP configuration
- [ ] Create backup of critical systems before making changes
- [ ] Verify system performance baseline
- [ ] Document current security policies and restrictions

## Phase 2: SAP Notes Installation

- [ ] Install SAP Note 2297281 (abapGit compatibility)
- [ ] Install SAP Note 2655547 (OAuth authentication for external interfaces)
- [ ] Install SAP Note 2573788 (Security for external integrations)
- [ ] Install SAP Note 2937996 (Support packages for abapGit)
- [ ] Install SAP Note 2960908 (API Management and OData integration)
- [ ] Verify successful installation of all SAP Notes
- [ ] Document any issues encountered during note installation
- [ ] Perform regression testing to ensure system stability

## Phase 3: Technical User Setup

- [ ] Create dedicated technical user for integration (e.g., GITHUB_SYNC)
- [ ] Assign S_DEVELOP authorization to technical user
- [ ] Assign S_TCODE authorization for required transactions
- [ ] Assign S_CTS_ADMI authorization for transport management
- [ ] Assign S_RFC authorization for RFC calls
- [ ] Assign S_SERVICE authorization for external services
- [ ] Set up secure password management for technical user
- [ ] Document technical user details (excluding password)
- [ ] Test technical user permissions by executing sample operations
- [ ] Configure user expiration and password policies per security requirements

## Phase 4: SAP Gateway Configuration

- [ ] Activate SAP Gateway service
- [ ] Configure required ICF services
- [ ] Set up security settings for external access
- [ ] Configure RFC destinations if needed
- [ ] Test connectivity from SAP Gateway to other systems
- [ ] Setup logging for gateway activities
- [ ] Configure rate limiting and throttling
- [ ] Implement IP restriction if required
- [ ] Document Gateway configuration

## Phase 5: Network Configuration

- [ ] Configure firewall rules to allow connectivity to GitHub
- [ ] Set up network routing between SAP and API Management
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS settings
- [ ] Import required certificates to SAP's trust store (transaction STRUST)
- [ ] Test network connectivity from SAP to GitHub
- [ ] Document network configuration details
- [ ] Create monitoring for network connectivity
- [ ] Setup alerts for network connectivity issues

## Progress Tracking

Use this table to track your overall progress:

| Phase | Total Tasks | Completed | Progress |
|-------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Phase 1: Preparation | 8 | 0 | 0% |
| Phase 2: SAP Notes Installation | 8 | 0 | 0% |
| Phase 3: Technical User Setup | 10 | 0 | 0% |
| Phase 4: SAP Gateway Configuration | 9 | 0 | 0% |
| Phase 5: Network Configuration | 8 | 0 | 0% |
| **TOTAL** | **43** | **0** | **0%** |

## üîß Implementation Decision Tree

- If using SAP S/4HANA:
  - Ensure Gateway is activated as part of your S/4HANA installation
  - Configure embedded Gateway if available
  - Use OData services for integration when possible
- If using SAP ECC 6.0:
  - Install Gateway add-on if not already present
  - Consider upgrading to latest EHP if below EHP7
  - Ensure ABAP stack is up to date
- If using firewalls between systems:
  - Configure outbound rules for SAP to API Management
  - Configure outbound rules for SAP to GitHub (if direct connection needed)
  - Work with network team to allow required ports and protocols

## ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps

After completing all checklist items:

1. Proceed to [abapGit Setup](./abapgit-setup.md)
2. Configure GitHub repository structure
3. Set up API Management for secure integration
