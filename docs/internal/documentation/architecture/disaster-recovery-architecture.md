    end
```

### Critical Integration Components

A comprehensive DR strategy must address all integration components, with particular attention to stateful and configuration components:

| Component Category | Examples | Criticality | Recovery Priority |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Source Code Repositories | Git repositories, wikis, release artifacts | High | 1 - Immediate |
| CI/CD Configuration | Pipeline definitions, environment configurations | High | 1 - Immediate |
| Integration Infrastructure | API gateways, message brokers, proxies | High | 1 - Immediate |
| Authentication Components | OAuth servers, certificate stores, SSO | High | 1 - Immediate |
| Self-hosted Runners | GitHub Actions runners, build servers | Medium | 2 - Next Business Day |
| Transport Management | Transport directories, configuration | High | 1 - Immediate |
| Monitoring Systems | Log aggregation, alerting, dashboards | Medium | 2 - Next Business Day |
| Documentation | Procedural documents, runbooks | Low | 3 - Within Week |

## Recovery Time and Point Objectives

### RTO and RPO Definitions

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) form the foundation of the DR strategy:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[System Failure] -->|Recovery Time| B[System Restored]
    A -->|Data Loss| C[Last Backup]
    
    classDef default fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef rto fill:#f8d7da,stroke:#721c24,stroke-width:1px
    classDef rpo fill:#d4edda,stroke:#155724,stroke-width:1px
    
    class A,B default
    class B rto
    class C rpo
```

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: The maximum acceptable time to restore service after a disruption
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: The maximum acceptable data loss measured in time

### Enterprise SAP-GitHub Integration Targets

| Component | RTO | RPO | Justification |
|-----------|-----|-----|---------------|
| GitHub Enterprise Server | 1 hour | 15 minutes | Critical development infrastructure |
| GitHub Enterprise Database | 1 hour | 5 minutes | Repository data integrity |
| SAP Development Systems | 4 hours | 1 hour | Development environment availability |
| SAP QA/Test Systems | 8 hours | 4 hours | Non-critical for immediate operation |
| SAP Production Systems | 1 hour | 15 minutes | Business-critical operations |
| Integration Infrastructure | 2 hours | 30 minutes | Pipeline dependencies |
| CI/CD Configuration | 1 hour | 1 hour | Deployment capabilities |
| Transport Management | 2 hours | 1 hour | Release management dependencies |

### Critical Path Analysis

BACKUP_DIR="/mnt/backup/github"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_PATH="$BACKUP_DIR/$TIMESTAMP"

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p $BACKUP_PATH

# Run GitHub backup
ghe-backup -v $BACKUP_PATH

# Verify backup
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Backup completed successfully to $BACKUP_PATH"
  # Create success marker
  touch "$BACKUP_PATH/backup_successful"
  
  # Cleanup old backups (keep last 30 days)
  find $BACKUP_DIR -type d -name "20*" -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} \;
else
  echo "Backup failed"
  # Send alert to monitoring system
  curl -X POST https://monitoring.example.com/api/alert \
    -d "{'service': 'github-backup', 'status': 'failed', 'severity': 'high'}"
fi

# Transfer to off-site storage

## Failover Strategies

### High Availability Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Primary Site"
        A[GitHub Enterprise Primary]
        B[SAP Primary Systems]
        C[Integration Primary]
    end
    
    subgraph "Secondary Site"
        D[GitHub Enterprise Secondary]
        E[SAP Secondary Systems]
        F[Integration Secondary]
    end
    
    A <-->|Replication| D
    B <-->|Replication| E
    C <-->|Replication| F
    
    G[Global Load Balancer] -->|Active| A
    G -->|Standby| D
```

### Failover Types

#### Active-Passive Failover

For GitHub Enterprise and stateful integration components:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant LoadBalancer as Load Balancer
    participant Primary as Primary System
    participant Secondary as Secondary System
    participant Monitor as Monitoring System
    
    User->>LoadBalancer: Request
    LoadBalancer->>Primary: Forward Request
    Primary->>LoadBalancer: Response
    LoadBalancer->>User: Response
    
    Primary->>Secondary: Continuous Replication
    
    Note over Primary: Failure Occurs
    Monitor->>Primary: Health Check (Failed)
    Monitor->>LoadBalancer: Trigger Failover
    
    LoadBalancer->>Secondary: Promote to Active
    
    User->>LoadBalancer: Request
    LoadBalancer->>Secondary: Forward Request
    Secondary->>LoadBalancer: Response
    LoadBalancer->>User: Response
```

**Implementation Guidelines**:

- Maintain up-to-date replicas with near-real-time synchronization
- Implement automated health checks with configurable thresholds
- Design failover processes that minimize or eliminate manual intervention
- Test failover procedures regularly as part of DR testing

#### Active-Active Configuration

For stateless integration components and read operations:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Requests] --> B[Global Load Balancer]
    B -->|Traffic Split| C[Region 1]
    B -->|Traffic Split| D[Region 2]
    
    subgraph "Region 1"
        C --> E[GitHub Enterprise 1]
        C --> F[Integration Components 1]
    end
    
    subgraph "Region 2"
        D --> G[GitHub Enterprise 2]
        D --> H[Integration Components 2]
    end
    
    E <-->|Data Sync| G
    F <-->|Config Sync| H
```

**Implementation Guidelines**:

- Use global load balancers with geo-routing capabilities
- Ensure data synchronization between active instances
- Implement consistent session handling
- Design for eventual consistency where applicable
