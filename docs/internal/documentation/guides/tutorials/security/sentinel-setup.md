}
```

6. Click "Apply" and then "Save"
7. Provide a name (e.g., "SAP-GitHub Security Monitoring")
8. Select appropriate location and save

### 6. Create Custom Analytics Rules

Create detection rules specific to the SAP-GitHub integration:

1. In your Sentinel workspace, navigate to "Analytics"
2. Click "Create" and select "Scheduled query rule"
3. Configure the rule:
   - **Name**: "Suspicious SAP-GitHub Transport Activity"
   - **Description**: "Detects unusual transport patterns between SAP and GitHub"
   - **Tactics**: Select appropriate MITRE ATT&CK tactics
   - **Severity**: Medium
   - **Status**: Enabled

4. In the "Set rule logic" section, enter this KQL query:

```kql
let timeframe = 1d;
let threshold = 3;
union
  AzureDiagnostics
  | where TimeGenerated >= ago(timeframe)
  | where Category == "GatewayLogs"
  | where httpMethod_s == "POST" 
  | where apiId_s contains "sap-transport" or operationId_s contains "transport",
  GitHubAuditData
  | where TimeGenerated >= ago(timeframe)
  | where OperationName contains "transport" or OperationName contains "workflow"
| summarize StartTime = min(TimeGenerated), EndTime = max(TimeGenerated), 
  count() by ClientIP = coalesce(clientIP_s, tostring(ClientIP), "unknown"), 
  User = coalesce(callerIPAddress_s, tostring(ActorIpAddress), "unknown"),
  Operation = coalesce(operationId_s, OperationName, "unknown")
| where count_ > threshold
| extend timestamp = StartTime
```

5. Configure the query scheduling and alert settings, then save the rule

### 7. Configure Incident Response Playbooks

Set up automated response playbooks for SAP-GitHub security incidents:

1. In your Sentinel workspace, navigate to "Automation"
2. Click "Create" and select "Playbook with incident trigger"
3. Configure a new Logic App with the following steps:
   - Trigger: When a Sentinel incident is created
   - Condition: Check if the incident involves SAP-GitHub integration
   - Actions:
     - Create a ServiceNow ticket or GitHub issue
     - Send email notification to security team
     - Add comment to the incident
     - Optional: Trigger a security scan on the affected repository

4. Save and enable the playbook

### 8. Enable User Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)

Configure UEBA to detect anomalous user behavior:

1. In your Sentinel workspace, navigate to "Entity behavior"
2. Click "Settings"
3. Enable data sources for both SAP and GitHub
4. Configure entity mapping for SAP and GitHub users
5. Set the analysis time window (recommended: 30 days)
6. Enable built-in anomaly detection rules

### 9. Validate the Configuration

Test your Sentinel configuration to ensure proper data collection:

1. Generate test events in your SAP system:
   - Attempt a few failed logins
   - Create and release a transport
   - Modify sensitive configuration

2. Generate test events in GitHub:
   - Create a pull request
   - Push a commit with a test security vulnerability
   - Trigger a CI/CD workflow

3. In Sentinel, navigate to "Logs" and run the following query to verify data collection:

```kql
search "SAP" or "GitHub"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| take 100
```

## Recommended Security Monitoring Scenarios

Configure the following key monitoring scenarios for your SAP-GitHub integration:

### 1. Unauthorized Transport Requests

Detection of unauthorized or suspicious transport requests between systems:

```kql
AzureDiagnostics
| where Category == "GatewayLogs"
| where apiId_s contains "sap-transport" 
| join kind=leftouter (
    SapAuditLog 
    | where Operation contains "transport"
) on $left.user_s == $right.User
| where isempty(User)
| project TimeGenerated, ClientIP = clientIP_s, User = user_s, Operation = operationId_s
```

### 2. GitHub Credential Misuse

Detection of potential GitHub credential misuse:

```kql
GitHubAuditData
| where OperationName contains "oauth_authorization" 
| summarize AuthCount = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), ActorIpAddress, ActorLogin
| join kind=inner (
    GitHubAuditData
    | where OperationName contains "oauth_authorization"
    | summarize DistinctIPs = dcount(ActorIpAddress) by ActorLogin
    | where DistinctIPs > 1
) on ActorLogin
| project TimeGenerated, ActorLogin, ActorIpAddress, AuthCount
```

### 3. Sensitive ABAP Code Modifications

Detection of changes to sensitive ABAP objects:

```kql
union
  GitHubAuditData,
  SapAuditLog
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| where OperationName contains "push" or Operation contains "MODI" 
| where ObjectName contains "AUTH" or ObjectName contains "SECURITY" or ObjectName contains "PAYMENT"
| project TimeGenerated, User = coalesce(ActorLogin, User), Operation = coalesce(OperationName, Operation), Object = coalesce(Repo, ObjectName)
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No SAP data in Sentinel | Verify the SAP connector configuration and check if audit logging is enabled in SAP |
| Missing GitHub events | Check the GitHub App permissions and webhook configuration |
| Workbook doesn't show data | Verify that the time range selected contains data and that all data connectors are properly configured |
| False positive alerts | Tune the detection rules by adjusting thresholds or adding exclusions |
