This repository contains a comprehensive technical playbook and reference implementation for integrating GitHub Enterprise with SAP S/4 HANA and ECC 6.0 environments using Microsoft Azure services for enhanced security and automation. The goal is to establish a fully automated, modern development pipeline for ABAP systems, eliminating manual synchronization and leveraging best-in-class tools for version control, CI/CD, security scanning, and monitoring.

**Value Proposition:** Modernize your SAP development lifecycle, improve developer productivity, enhance security posture, and accelerate time-to-market for SAP customizations and applications.

## Architecture Overview

*Placeholder: Insert a high-level architecture diagram here (e.g., in `assets/architecture_overview.png`). Link it below.*

![Architecture Overview](assets/architecture_overview.png) <!-- Update path if needed -->

This solution integrates the following core components:

*   **GitHub Enterprise:** Source code management, branch strategies, pull requests, and code reviews.
*   **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD automation for build, test, and deployment.
*   **GitHub Advanced Security:** Code scanning (including ABAP), secret scanning, and dependency review.
*   **GitHub Copilot:** AI-powered code completion and assistance for ABAP development.
*   **abapGit:** Enables Git-based version control for ABAP development objects.
*   **Microsoft API Management (APIM):** Securely exposes SAP APIs and manages integrations.
*   **Microsoft Sentinel:** Centralized security information and event management (SIEM) for monitoring SAP and GitHub environments.
*   **Microsoft Defender for Cloud:** Provides cloud security posture management (CSPM) and workload protection (CWP) for SAP and related Azure resources.
*   **SAP S/4 HANA / ECC 6.0:** Target SAP environments (Development, Quality Assurance, Production).

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

*   Access to GitHub Enterprise.
*   Access to SAP S/4 HANA or ECC 6.0 landscape (DEV, QAS, PRD).
*   Azure Subscription with permissions to create APIM, Sentinel, and Defender resources.
*   Necessary SAP authorizations for abapGit and API integration.
*   Basic understanding of Git, CI/CD, SAP Transport Management, and Azure services.

[**See full prerequisites >>**](./docs/getting-started/prerequisites.md)

### Getting Started Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO.git`
2.  **Review Prerequisites:** Ensure your environment meets all requirements listed in [prerequisites.md](./docs/getting-started/prerequisites.md).
3.  **Configure GitHub:** Set up repositories, branch protection rules, and secrets as described in the [GitHub Setup Guide](./docs/implementation/github-setup/index.md).
4.  **Prepare SAP Systems:** Install and configure abapGit and necessary ICF services following the [SAP Setup Guide](./docs/implementation/sap-setup/index.md).
5.  **Set Up Azure Services:** Deploy and configure Microsoft APIM, Sentinel, and Defender as outlined in the [APIM Setup](./docs/implementation/apim-setup/index.md) and [Security Setup](./docs/implementation/security-setup/index.md) guides.
6.  **Implement Workflows:** Adapt and deploy the example GitHub Actions workflows from the [examples/github-actions](./examples/github-actions) directory. See the [Workflows Guide](./docs/implementation/workflows/index.md).
7.  **Explore Examples:** Review the code examples in the [`/examples`](./examples) directory.
8.  **Consult Documentation:** Refer to the [`/docs`](./docs) directory for detailed implementation steps, reference material, and troubleshooting.
