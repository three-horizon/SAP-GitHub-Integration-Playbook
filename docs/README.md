# SAP-GitHub Integration Playbook Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the SAP-GitHub Integration Playbook. This documentation is structured to provide a progressive learning path, from high-level architecture to detailed technical implementation guides.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

1. **[Architecture](./1-architecture/README.md)** - System architecture, component design, and integration patterns
2. **[Implementation Guide](./2-implementation-guide/README.md)** - Step-by-step implementation instructions
3. **[Developer Guide](./3-developer-guide/README.md)** - Developer workflows, APIs, and coding standards
4. **[Operations Guide](./4-operations-guide/README.md)** - Monitoring, maintenance, and troubleshooting
5. **[Reference](./5-reference/README.md)** - Technical specifications, glossary, and resources
6. **[Appendices](./6-appendices/README.md)** - FAQs, troubleshooting, and supplementary materials

## Role-Based Entry Points

Depending on your role, you may want to start with different sections of the documentation:

- **Executives**: Start with the [Executive Overview](../EXECUTIVE-OVERVIEW.md)
- **Solution Architects**: Begin with the [Architecture](./1-architecture/README.md) section
- **Implementation Teams**: Focus on the [Implementation Guide](./2-implementation-guide/README.md)
- **Developers**: Go directly to the [Developer Guide](./3-developer-guide/README.md)
- **Operations Teams**: See the [Operations Guide](./4-operations-guide/README.md)
