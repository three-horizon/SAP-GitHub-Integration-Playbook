## ROI Calculation Methodology

### Basic ROI Formula

```
ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs Ã— 100%
```

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

```
NPV = Initial Investment + Î£(Cashflow_t / (1 + r)^t)
```
Where:
- `Cashflow_t` = Net cash flow in period t
- `r` = Discount rate
- `t` = Time period

### Payback Period Calculation

```
Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Net Benefit
```

## Sample ROI Analysis

### Assumptions

- **Organization Size**: 50 ABAP developers
- **Implementation Timeline**: 6 months
- **Analysis Period**: 3 years
- **Discount Rate**: 10%
- **Developer Fully-Loaded Cost**: $120,000/year
- **Production Incident Cost**: $5,000/incident
