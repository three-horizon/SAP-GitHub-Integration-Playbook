## 📋 Overview

This guide provides a framework for implementing DevSecOps practices in the SAP-GitHub integration. DevSecOps extends the DevOps philosophy by integrating security practices throughout the development lifecycle, ensuring that security is built in from the start, not added as an afterthought.

## 🏗️ DevSecOps Principles

Core principles of DevSecOps:

1. **Shift Left Security** - Move security earlier in the development process
2. **Automate Security Testing** - Include security in automated testing
3. **Continuous Security Monitoring** - Monitor for security issues continuously
4. **Security as Code** - Manage security configurations as code
5. **Collaboration** - Promote collaboration between development, operations, and security teams

## 🔁 CI/CD Lifecycle

Secure CI/CD implementation:

- [CICD Lifecycle](./cicd-lifecycle.md) - Secure CI/CD process
- [Build Security](./build-security.md) - Secure build processes
- [Test Security](./test-security.md) - Security testing in CI/CD
- [Deployment Security](./deployment-security.md) - Secure deployment practices

> **💡 Tip:** Implement quality gates at each stage of the CI/CD pipeline to enforce security standards.

## 🛡️ Security Integration

Security mechanisms across the lifecycle:

| Phase | Security Measures | Implementation |
|:------|:------------------|:---------------|
| Plan | Secure Requirements | [Planning Security](./planning-security.md) |
| Code | Secure Coding | [Coding Security](./coding-security.md) |
| Build | Dependency Scanning | [Build Security](./build-security.md) |
| Test | Security Testing | [Test Security](./test-security.md) |
| Deploy | Secure Deployment | [Deployment Security](./deployment-security.md) |
| Operate | Security Monitoring | [Operations Security](./operations-security.md) |

## 📊 Metrics and Monitoring

Track security metrics:

- [Security Metrics](./security-metrics.md)
- [Vulnerability Trends](./vulnerability-trends.md)
- [Compliance Metrics](./compliance-metrics.md)
- [Performance Security](./performance-security.md)

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

Steps to implement DevSecOps:

1. [Assessment](./assessment.md) - Evaluate current security posture
2. [Tool Selection](./tool-selection.md) - Select appropriate security tools
3. [Process Integration](./process-integration.md) - Integrate into development processes
4. [Team Training](./team-training.md) - Train teams on secure practices
5. [Continuous Improvement](./continuous-improvement.md) - Iterate and improve
