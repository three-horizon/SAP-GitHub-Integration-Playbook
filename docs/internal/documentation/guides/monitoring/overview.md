## Alerting Strategy

Implement a tiered alerting framework to minimize alert fatigue and ensure appropriate response:

### Severity Levels

1. **Critical (P1)**: Immediate attention required, system unavailable or severe security issue
2. **High (P2)**: Urgent attention required, significant functionality impacted
3. **Medium (P3)**: Important issue requiring attention, limited impact
4. **Low (P4)**: Minor issue, tracked for resolution during normal maintenance

### Alert Routing

Configure alerts to reach the appropriate teams based on component and severity:

<div align="center">

| Component | Critical (P1) | High (P2) | Medium (P3) | Low (P4) |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| SAP System | SAP Basis Team + Ops | SAP Basis Team | SAP Basis Team | Dashboard |
| GitHub | GitHub Admins + Ops | GitHub Admins | GitHub Admins | Dashboard |
| Integration | Integration Team + Ops | Integration Team | Integration Team | Dashboard |
| Security | Security Team + All | Security Team | Security Team | Dashboard |

</div>
