## Overview

Repository security is critical for protecting SAP code and artifacts stored in GitHub. This document provides guidance on implementing robust security measures for your repositories as part of the SAP-GitHub integration.

## Branch Protection Rules

Branch protection rules prevent unauthorized changes and ensure quality control:

1. **Protect Default Branches**
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require signed commits
   - Restrict who can push to matching branches

2. **Rule Configuration**
   ```
   Branch name pattern: main
   Require pull requests
   Require approvals: 2
   Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   Require status checks to pass before merging
   Require branches to be up to date before merging
   Require signed commits
   Include administrators
   ```

3. **SAP-Specific Considerations**
   - Enforce heightened protection for branches containing transport requests
   - Consider additional protection for branches with direct SAP system integration

## Code Scanning and Secret Detection

Implement automated scanning to prevent security vulnerabilities and credential exposure:

1. **GitHub Advanced Security**
   - Enable code scanning with CodeQL
   - Configure secret scanning
   - Set up dependabot alerts
   - Configure security advisories

2. **SAP-Specific Scans**
   - Implement custom CodeQL queries for ABAP code
   - Configure SAP Transport Request validation
   - Scan for SAP-specific security patterns

3. **Implementation Example**
   ```yaml
   name: "SAP Code Scanning"
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main ]
     schedule:
       - cron: '30 1 * * 0'
   
   jobs:
     analyze:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       permissions:
         security-events: write
       
       steps:
       - name: Checkout repository
         uses: actions/checkout@v3
       
       - name: Initialize CodeQL
         uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
         with:
           languages: abap, javascript
           queries: security-extended,security-and-quality
       
       - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
         uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
   ```

## Access Control

Implement principle of least privilege for repository access:

1. **Repository Access**
   - Use teams rather than individual access
   - Implement role-based permissions
   - Regularly audit repository access

2. **CODEOWNERS File**
   - Implement CODEOWNERS for critical components
   - Ensure SAP development teams are assigned to relevant code
   - Example:
     ```
     # ABAP Core Components
     /abap/ @sap-abap-team
     
     # SAP UI5 Components
     /ui5/ @sap-ui-team
     
     # Transport Configuration
     /config/transport/ @sap-transport-admins
     
     # Integration Components
     /integration/ @sap-integration-team
     ```

3. **Security Controls**
   - Enforce 2FA for all contributors
   - Implement IP allowlisting where appropriate
   - Integrate with SSO for centralized identity management

## Security Monitoring

Monitor repository activity for security issues:

1. **Audit Logging**
   - Enable enhanced audit logging
   - Integrate with SIEM solutions
   - Define security anomaly detection

2. **Automated Alerting**
   - Configure alerts for unusual activity
   - Set up notifications for security events
   - Integrate with incident response processes

3. **Regular Reviews**
   - Conduct quarterly access reviews
   - Review security findings and remediation status
   - Update protection rules based on evolving threats

## Implementation Steps

Follow these steps to secure your repositories:

1. **Assessment**
   - Inventory existing repositories
   - Classify repositories by sensitivity
   - Identify protection requirements

2. **Configuration**
   - Set up branch protection rules
   - Enable Advanced Security features
   - Configure CODEOWNERS

3. **Testing**
   - Validate protection rules
   - Test security scanning
   - Verify access controls

4. **Documentation**
   - Document security controls
   - Provide guidelines for developers
   - Establish security review process

## Next Steps

- Review [Authentication Configuration](./authentication.md) for user access
- Implement [Advanced Security](./advanced-security.md) features
- Configure [Security Monitoring](../security-setup/security-monitoring.md)
