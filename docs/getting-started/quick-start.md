# Quick Start Guide

This quick start guide helps you begin using the SAP-GitHub integration immediately after installation. It covers the core workflows for both ABAP developers and system administrators.

## Overview

The SAP-GitHub integration enables a modern development workflow for SAP ABAP systems:

1. Develop code in SAP â†’ Push to GitHub
2. Collaborate in GitHub (code reviews, branches) 
3. Automated testing and validation
4. Automated deployment back to SAP systems

## For ABAP Developers

### Initial Repository Setup

If your package hasn't been connected to GitHub yet:

1. In SAP, execute transaction `/GOOG/ZGIT_ADMIN` (or your custom transaction)
2. Select **Create New Repository**
3. Enter:
   - **SAP Package**: Your ABAP package name (e.g., `Z_CUSTOMER_APP`)
   - **GitHub Repository**: Target repository (e.g., `my-org/sap-customer-app`)
   - **Transport Request**: Enter or create a transport request
4. Click **Create Connection**

### Daily Development Workflow

#### 1. Working on a New Feature

1. In SAP, create or modify ABAP objects within your package
2. Execute transaction `/GOOG/ZGIT_DEV` (or your custom transaction)
3. Select the package
4. Click **Push to GitHub**
5. Enter commit message and transport request
6. Choose **Create Feature Branch** and enter a branch name (e.g., `feature/new-billing-logic`)
7. Click **Push**

This creates:
- A feature branch in GitHub with your changes
- A pull request to the `dev` branch (if configured)
- A transport request (if not provided)

#### 2. Code Review Process

1. In GitHub, open the pull request
2. Reviewers comment and request changes
3. Address feedback in SAP
4. Push additional commits following step 1 procedure
5. Once approved, merge the pull request to `dev` branch

#### 3. Viewing Deployment Status

1. In GitHub, navigate to **Actions** tab
2. View the status of automated workflows
3. Check deployment status in environment section
4. In SAP, execute transaction `/GOOG/ZGIT_DEV` and select **View Status**

## For System Administrators

### Monitoring the Integration

1. Access the Azure Portal
2. Navigate to your API Management instance
3. View metrics in the **Analytics** section
4. Check **Logs** for errors and activity

### Security Monitoring

1. In Azure Portal, navigate to Microsoft Sentinel
2. Open the SAP-GitHub Integration Workbook
3. Review security alerts and events
4. Investigate anomalies using provided query templates

### Common Administrative Tasks

#### Updating Repository Configuration

1. In SAP, execute transaction `/GOOG/ZGIT_ADMIN`
2. Select the repository to update
3. Modify settings as needed
4. Save changes

#### Managing Transport Requests

1. In SAP, execute transaction `STMS`
2. View transports created via GitHub integration
3. View status and details
4. Manually intervene if necessary

#### Refreshing GitHub Tokens

1. In SAP, execute transaction `/GOOG/ZGIT_ADMIN`
2. Select **Manage Connections**
3. Select the connection to update
4. Click **Refresh Token**
5. Follow authentication prompts

## Example: End-to-End Development Scenario

### Creating a New Report

1. **In SAP (DEV system):**
   - Create a new report `ZTEST_GITHUB_INTEGRATION`
   - Add basic functionality
   - Save and activate the object

2. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Execute `/GOOG/ZGIT_DEV`
   - Select your package
   - Choose **Push to GitHub**
   - Enter commit message: "Add test report for GitHub integration"
   - Create branch: `feature/test-report`
   - Provide transport request
   - Click **Push**

3. **In GitHub:**
   - Open pull request
   - Request review
   - CI/CD workflows run automatically
   - Review test results

4. **After Approval:**
   - Merge pull request to `dev`
   - GitHub Actions workflow runs
   - Transport is automatically created/released
   - Code is deployed to QAS system

5. **After QAS Testing:**
   - Create pull request from `dev` to `qas`
   - Merge to deploy to QAS
   - After QAS validation, create PR from `qas` to `main`
   - Merge to deploy to PRD

## Common Issues and Quick Fixes

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Unable to connect to GitHub | Check API keys and network connectivity |
| Transport errors | Verify transport layer configuration |
| Workflow failures | Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors |
| Authorization issues | Verify SAP technical user has required permissions |
| Missing objects in GitHub | Check package assignment and abapGit configuration |
