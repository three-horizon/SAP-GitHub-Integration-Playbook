## Implementation Journey

The documentation follows a sequential implementation journey with continuous step numbering across tutorials (Steps 1-224), enabling you to:

1. Understand the integration architecture and components
2. Prepare your environment with the necessary prerequisites
3. Install and configure abapGit in your SAP system
4. Set up your first SAP-GitHub project connection
5. Implement proper development workflows with branching
6. Establish continuous integration with automated testing
7. Enhance your implementation with code reviews and security
8. Optimize development with AI-assisted tools like GitHub Copilot for ABAP

## Getting Started

To begin your SAP-GitHub integration implementation:

1. Review the [Technical Overview](./1-overview/technical-overview.md) to understand the architecture
2. Verify your systems meet the [System Requirements](./2-prerequisites/system-requirements.md)
3. Start with [Tutorial 1: Installing abapGit in SAP System](./3-setup-guide/installing-abapgit.md)
4. Follow each tutorial in sequence, completing the verification steps

## Technical Foundation

This playbook focuses exclusively on the technical implementation of the SAP-GitHub integration, providing detailed, step-by-step instructions for establishing:

- Version control for SAP development objects
- Collaborative development using branches and pull requests
- Continuous integration with automated testing
- Code quality improvement through reviews
- Security hardening for the integration
- Developer productivity enhancements with GitHub Copilot for ABAP
