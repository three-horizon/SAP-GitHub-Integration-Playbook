## Overview

This document provides a phase-based implementation checklist for the SAP-GitHub integration. It breaks down the implementation into logical phases with clear tasks to help you track progress through the complete implementation journey.

## How to Use This Checklist

Use this checklist to track your implementation progress:

- [ ] Uncompleted task
- [x] Completed task

You can copy this checklist to your own tracking document or project management tool. Each phase should be completed before proceeding to the next, though some phases may overlap in larger implementations.
