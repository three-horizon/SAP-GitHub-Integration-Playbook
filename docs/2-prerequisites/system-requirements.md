# System Requirements for SAP-GitHub Integration

## Introduction

This document outlines the technical requirements for implementing the SAP-GitHub integration. Ensuring your systems meet these requirements is essential before proceeding with the setup and configuration tutorials.

## SAP System Requirements

### Software Requirements

| Component | Minimum Version | Recommended Version |
|---|---|---|
| SAP NetWeaver | 7.40 | 7.52 or higher |
| ABAP | 7.40 | 7.55 or higher |
| SAP_BASIS | 740 | 752 or higher |
| SAP GUI | 7.50 | 7.60 or higher |

### Support Package Requirements

Ensure your SAP system has the following minimum support package levels:

- SAP_BASIS: SAPKB74009 (7.40 SP09) or higher
- SAP_ABA: SAPKA74009 (7.40 SP09) or higher

### SAP Notes

The following SAP Notes must be implemented in your system:

| SAP Note | Description | Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| 2431196 | XMLHttpRequest compatibility for ABAP platforms | Required for HTTPS communication |
| 2195019 | ABAP: HTTPS, SMTP and proxy problems after upgrade | Required for SSL connections |
| 2716778 | abapGit SSL issue in NW 7.5x | Required for systems on NW 7.5x |

### Authorization Requirements

Users implementing the integration need the following authorizations:

- Development authorization (S_DEVELOP)
- Authorization for transaction SE80 (ABAP Workbench)
- Authorization for transaction SE38 (ABAP Editor)
- Authorization to create and modify Z* objects
- Optional: Transport management authorizations (if using transport system)

## GitHub Requirements

### Account and Repository

- GitHub account (personal or organization)
- Authorization to create and manage repositories
- Ability to generate personal access tokens

### Network Requirements

- HTTPS outbound access from SAP system to GitHub (port 443)
- No proxy restrictions for GitHub domains
- DNS resolution for GitHub domains

## Client Workstation Requirements

### Software Requirements

- SAP GUI 7.50 or higher
- Modern web browser for GitHub access (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Network access to both SAP system and GitHub

### Optional Tools

- Git client for local operations
- Visual Studio Code with ABAP extensions for local development

## Network and Security Requirements

### Firewall Configuration

Ensure your network firewall allows:

- Outbound HTTPS (TCP port 443) connections from SAP servers to GitHub domains
  - github.com
  - api.github.com
  - raw.githubusercontent.com

### SSL/TLS Requirements

- TLS 1.2 or higher support
- SSL certificates properly configured
- Trust configuration in SAP system (transaction STRUST)

## Storage and Performance Considerations

- Sufficient application server disk space (at least 1GB free space recommended)
- Adequate database space for additional development objects
- Memory and CPU capacity for additional background processes

## Verification Checklist

Before proceeding with [Tutorial 1: Installing abapGit in SAP System](../3-setup-guide/installing-abapgit.md), verify:

- [ ] SAP system meets the minimum version requirements
- [ ] All required SAP Notes are implemented
- [ ] User authorizations are properly assigned
- [ ] Network connectivity to GitHub is available
- [ ] SSL/TLS configuration is properly set up
- [ ] Sufficient system resources are available

## Common Prerequisite Issues

### SSL Certificate Problems

**Issue**: SAP system cannot establish secure connections to GitHub

**Solution**:
1. Verify that your SAP system can establish HTTPS connections
2. Check that required SAP Notes for HTTPS are implemented
3. Ensure SSL certificates are properly configured in STRUST

### Authorization Issues

**Issue**: Users cannot create or modify objects

**Solution**:
1. Verify that developers have the necessary authorization profiles
2. Check S_DEVELOP authorizations for required object types
3. Ensure access to required transactions (SE80, SE38, etc.)

### Network Connectivity Issues

**Issue**: SAP system cannot connect to GitHub

**Solution**:
1. Verify that your firewall allows outbound HTTPS connections
2. Check if a proxy is required and properly configured
3. Test connectivity using transaction SMICM or SM59

## Next Steps
